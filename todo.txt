# TODO:

## for multi-backend:

* addAccount for 'remotestorage', 'googledrive', 'dropbox'
  * call current setBackend and configure from rs.js
  * use this in butler and remove getButlerConfig
* meute.private(moduleName), meute.public(moduleName)
* meute.setPermission({}) -> DataStore format

## for push notifications:

* save messages to messages module
* send simple-push to Firefox OS device

## for collaboration:

* idea: use rss feeds publishing, basically, vector clocks.
* follow feeds of others and merge their commits into your own version.
* backend-agnostic: anybody who can publish an rss feed, can participate.
* simple: use sha1 to quickly confirm distributed merges gave the same result.
* if there is an incoming change, apply it
* if there is a conflict, fire a keep/revert event with origin: collab
* advanced: use Merckle-tree hashing to describe and store your version of each file.

## backlog:

* use localhost as an example
* add example of how to add an email account
* check email docs
* check www docs (update them for web-authoring!)
* see https://github.com/michielbdejong/meute/issues
