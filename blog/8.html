<h1>Saving the web</h1>

<p>Three years ago I quit my day job to save the web. I spent this time mainly working out how unhosted web apps can work. I met some wonderful people who joined and together we created the unhosted web apps "movement", from which remoteStorage, 5apps, and sockethub sprang. We experimented and discussed a lot. In the meantime I was also involved in setting up "Terms of Service; Didn't Read", which in terms of direct user impact was actually many orders of magnitude more successful than remoteStorage so far, and I thought quite a few times that I should be working on this other side project Opentabs instead. It has been a lot of fun, and it still is.</p>

<p>Before I quit my job, I was working at Tuenti.com, a Spanish social network which was wildly successful. This meant kids in the street would treat you like a celebrity when they see you walk out of the office, and want to take their picture with you whenever you wear a T-shirt or a hoodie with the name of your employer on it. Working at Tuenti was not only great because people sometimes treat you like a rock star; it was also a great place to work with some of the best engineers in Spain brought together, and working with such a lot of servers was exciting both because of the amazing scale and impact of your everyday tasks, and the originality of challenges you face, boldly going where only memcache has gone before.</p>

<p>Some of the excellent engineers who were at Tuenti at the time are now at Google or Facebook. In the industry, at least for us, making it into Google, or even knowing somebody who made it into Google, is like if someone from your sports team makes it to the Olympics. It's the ultimate fame. We're all implicitly trying to climb a ladder, and Google is simply at the top. Making it into Tuenti is already a carreer achievement, and therefore a significant odds multiplier for this, both because it acts as a pre-selection, and because it is a unique and valuable training. There are not so many places in Europe where you can work with Giga-pagehits-per-day infrastructure and be surrounded by dozens of people who are smarter than you, and the recruiters know this.</p>

<p>This was one of the things I had to consider when quitting my job to pursue this unsure non-profit project: I was basically giving up a valuable carreer. Except, I wasn't. One colleague already told me "within a year of working full-time on a free software project, you'll receive a phone call from one of the big ones." I didn't believe her at the time, but she was right: within a year, both Google and Facebook asked me to come for an interview.</p>

<p>It makes sense as well in hindsight - people who lead a free software project are simply very visible. You end up talking at conferences and getting mentioned on Twitter. I'm quite an average engineer, but now at least I'm visible to recruiters, instead of being a nameless average engineer somewhere in a department at the back office of some company in some country. During the last 3 years I only took just enough money to get by from the donations pot, and didn't build up any savings or pension. In fact, I spent all my savings, including the "pension" part which I said I wasn't going to touch, on the project. But because of this visibility, I could now probably get a much better paid job than three years ago, if I wanted to. In a way, quitting my carreer was the best carreer move I ever made! :)</p>

<h2>I chose not to choose life</h2>

<p>A lot of people who work on a free software project, do end up getting recruited that way. The logical next step for me would be to round up and finish my "Unhosted Adventures" blog series on unhosted.org and get a nice job again somewhere. In fact, I would like to do that. I like being an employee in a good team. I like being a cog. Right now, I see myself more as a projectile than as a cog. Being a projectile is stressful and often hard. PhD students know this, for instance. You become a world-level expert in some tiny topic, which is amazingly exciting in some ways, but in practice, you find out you also have to learn to self-motivate, and that is fucking hard. What I didn't know when I started, is that saving the web is fucking hard in that same way. You have to self-motivate and stubbornly believe that where you are going is where your virtual shareholders (namely, all the future users of the web), want you to go. Being a cog in the machine is much more mindless, and therefore much more comfortable.</p>

<p>The obvious solution to this dilemma is to aim for the promised land, as I call it. In my case, the promised land would be Mozilla. People there have the professional comfort of being part of something bigger, yet they still get to work on saving the web. Also, unlike most other "you-made-it-to-the-Olympics" employers, Mozilla doesn't force you to move to some horrible suburban (silicon) valley which I heard is populated primarily by SUVs. And you get to work with all these awesome Mozillians. I imagine working for Mozilla would be amazing.</p>

<p>In your case, the promised land might be Canonical, RedHat, Spotify (arguably), or Joyent (getting paid to work on Node), etcetera. Having a job again would definitely help me fit into polite society better. I could still be doing something just as valuable, or maybe even more valuable, for humanity. In fact, if the goal is doing what I'm good at (or in my case, what I'm average at), with maximum impact on humanity, I should probably move to New York and become a web developer for charity:water (look them up if you haven't heard about charity:water yet).</p>

<p>But despite the fact that being a projectile on an underfunded rogue project is fucking hard, something is holding me back from sending my CV to charity:water just yet. Partially, being outside my professional comfort zone is an adventure; it is exciting because I never know what's going to happen next. It is a "life hack" that makes me feel like I didn't grow up yet. I like to think of myself as being about 7 or 8 years retarded. As I'm starting to push 39 now, I'm finally starting to feel older than 28-year-olds, and starting to fit in with people in their early 30s. I like to keep it that way, because I still have a hell of a lot of time left in my life for getting old, repaying a mortgage, and rotting away at the end of it all. Choose a job? In the words of Trainspotting, I chose not to chose life. I chose something else. It's uncomfortable, but it's bloody exciting.</p>

<h2>Indie Web</h2>

<p>There is another, more important reason why I am now not pursuing job opportunities which a few years ago I could only dream about. If my only goal would be to live an exciting and interesting life then I would quit programming right now and become a musician. And if I saw enough people worldwide already working on saving the web, then I probably would. Enough would be, say, 10,000 full-time engineers. If those people existed, then I would rest assured that the web is going to be just fine, and make music instead for the rest of my days.</p>

<p>When we started working on unhosted web apps, it looked like the Diaspora project had the most traction to be able to save the web. I used to say our project was "a bit like Diaspora". I now sometimes explain it's "a bit like ownCloud". Many of the people who were enthusiastic about Federated Social Web at the time are now enthusiastic about the Indie Web. There is a general consensus among engineers that decentralization and open standards are extremely important for optimizing the way in which technology is reshaping our world. We all see that Linux, Wikipedia, and the open web are of incredible value to the people on this planet.</p>

<p>By saving the web I mean several things, but they basically amount to stopping the current trend where consumer tech is dominated by a shrinking number of monopoly platforms, and the web is becoming just a transport to connect users with one of them. If we let this trend continue then we will all have our user data on either Apple's iCloud, GoogleDrive, Microsoft's SkyDrive, or Dropbox Platform. These 4 platforms will not be compatible with each other, and the software tools you will be able to use will depend on which platform you have your data stored on. The task of saving the web consists of separating software, device, cloud, and contacts all back into independently open layers.</p>

<p>Primarily, I would say, our task is to push the web as a universal platform that separates software from device hardware, so that one software tool (app) can be used on any hardware device. Mozilla, W3C, and Google are contributing to this by pushing the html standard forward, both in the browser and on mobile. I don't have any numbers, but I guess there must be about 500 people working full-time specifically developing the html platform. I imagine like 100 people developing WebRTC, 100 developing CSS, etcetera, adding up so some 3-digit number - let me know if you have a better estimate. These heroes are literally one in a million among the world population, but it feels like they're standing their ground against iOS and making very rapid progress.</p>

<p>Second, there is the network effect of cross-cloud communication between contacts. Indie Web fixes that by breaking open the social web silos and allowing cross-silo communication. Hugely important research for the future of consumer tech. But the number of full-time people working specifically on Indie Web is nowhere the number of people needed to do the job. The number of people working full-time on federated social web is rapidly shrinking, and the Indie Web consists of 10 or 20 people, if you look at the wiki and the irc channel. Let's call it 50 people in total, maybe? And then, we are not even talking about 50 full-time engineers. Many of these 50 or so people who work on this are hobbyists who have a day job on the side, or whose day-to-day will consist largely of paid gigs for clients.</p>

<p>And lastly, when software apps are device independent, we are not done yet. We will still need to make sure both our software choice and our device choice stay separate from our choice of personal cloud storage. We need to stop device vendors from locking up with cloud storage vendors (iPhone-iCloud, Android-GoogleDrive, WindowsPhone-SkyDrive). And we need to stop software-based platforms from locking developers into developing apps for a specific cloud storage platform. This is what remoteStorage is all about: a standard, cross-origin interface to connect a user's own cloud storage with a web app they are running. I am convinced that this is, after the html platform breaking open device platforms, and the indie web breaking open social platforms, remoteStorage is the third thing the web really needs today, breaking open user data platforms.</p>

<p>And now here's the thing: We are less than a handful of people working full-time on remoteStorage, whichever way you count. PouchDB, NimbusBase, Hoodie and a few other projects are all similar to remoteStorage in some way, but as far as I know, remoteStorage is the only project in the world that is aiming to create per-user data storage for the web. That is positively scary. We are such a small percentage of the world population working on such important stuff. Right? Or am I being crazy here? I hope now you understand that it would be simply irresponsible of me to stop working on that, even if I wanted to.</p>

<h2>The 0.000001% of us</h2>

<p>If you look at the reasons people list to work on Indie Web, they all focus on the benefits of having your own website. I think this wiki page has been written like that on purpose, but I still find it striking. I don't care about having a website myself, I could easily do without it. Apart from keeping up with tech news via Twitter, I have personally never been a big user of the social web. The reason I am now starting my own Indie Web site, is that so many non-programmers can't.</p>

<p>There is so much activity in the world that is just concerned with running shops and building houses. A lot of the base luxury, and safety from heat/cold/hunger/thirst/illness/injury, comes from this activity. Then there is the technology boom into which our generation was born. In the future, people will probably look back at our century mainly as when the internet was invented. They will probably look back at our decade as when the iPhone was invented. Billions of people work on running shops and building houses, and that's fine. But I have this crazy idea that if you're smart enough to work this out, then it is therefore your responsibility to work on something more useful.</p>

<p>About 0.1% of us who know how to write a computer program and run a server. The other 99.9% of the world population can not choose to join the Indie Web, because they don't possess the skills. Think about that. Of those few million programmers, the vast majority doesn't care about contributing to open technology. That's their fair choice and freedom.</p>

<p>But I'm one of the people who, inspired by Eben Moglen's "Freedom in the Cloud" talk and the encouragement of one colleague at the time, said yes, let's give it a go, let's try and save the web. I'm convinced that it's a bloody important task, in the same way a soldier is convinced it's bloody important to represent their nation state in a war, and a monk is convinced it's bloody important to represent their community by sitting in a monastery. It feels like there is just a very very very small percentage of people on this earth convinced that they have to save the web. But I'm one of them.</p>

<p>And that is my reason to continue to work on remoteStorage, and also my reason to join the Indie Web. I'll link to this page from <a href="https://indiewebcamp.com/why">https://indiewebcamp.com/why</a>.</p>
